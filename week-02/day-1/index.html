    <h1>Nagy Eszter</h1>
    <p>
        I love to design complex sytems with high levels of automation including AI and robotics. I'm deeply interested in inventing new things that can augment the human experience. 
        Everything I've done, everything I'll do today, everything I'll ever do, I do to protect this world. Someone once told me that with great power comes great responsibility.
